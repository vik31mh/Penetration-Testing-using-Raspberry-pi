## Setup

1. Flash and install the 64-bit Raspbian operating system to an SD card using an SD card reader.  
2. Connect the Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi 4 Model B) to a monitor, keyboard, and power.  
3. Use a Kali Linux virtual machine (VMware) to perform the penetration tests.

## Brute-force attack (Hydra)

Create `username` and `password` lists (two text documents). Example files: `username.txt` and `password.txt` (these files included the correct credentials used in the test: `CSE` / `CSE`).

Run Hydra against SSH:
```bash
hydra -L <path_to_username_list> -P <path_to_password_list> ssh://<target_ip>
